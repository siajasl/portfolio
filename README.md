# Portfolio

- Polygot clean-code portfolio of projects past and present.  

- All code has been handcrafted - i.e. pre-ai :).  

- My coding philosphy can be summed up as follows: "Islands of complexity in a sea of simplicity".

- All code existed within context of production systems - they are not hobby projects :).

- Before code there is system design ... that's another of my skillsets.
